# Self-Hosting a Portier Broker

Portier is __not yet ready__ for self-hosting, but will be soon.

Specifically, it should be ready for self-hosting in 2017. We're taking the time between now and then to kick the tires, complete some final fit-and-finish bugs, and make sure that the core design is sound.

If you would like to help us get there faster, please refer to the [open issues](https://github.com/portier/portier-broker/issues) and [README.rst](https://github.com/portier/portier-broker/blob/master/README.rst) for the reference implementation at [portier/portier-broker](https://github.com/portier/portier-broker).
